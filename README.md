This manuscript presents a city-wide DRL-based ATSC for autonomous vehicles. State-of-the-art metrics like TOT and TOS served to comprehensively compare its performance with conventional SARSA ($\lambda$), SARSA ($\lambda$)-MinMax and SARSA ($\lambda$)-SD-based traffic signal controllers. The results demonstrated a reduction of average TOT and TOS by a mean value of $59.9$\% and $17.55$\% compared to the mentioned baselines. This study also evaluates the performance of two routing algorithms: Dijkstra and A-star, on the proposed traffic signal controller. The A-star showed better performances than the Dijkstra by minimizing the average trip time loss and increasing the average trip speed to $124.38s$ and $5.96 m/s$, which achieved $8.9$\% and $3.4$\% improvements, respectively, compared to its counterpart. Hence, this study verifies that the autonomous vehicles' trip performance can be further increased by combining the A-star routing algorithm and the proposed traffic signal controller. 
In future, more traffic signalling phases need to be considered, mainly when pedestrians crossings along the intersection will be inserted. Also, it requires the investigation of a Deep Q-network instead of TD learning for further performance enhancement.
